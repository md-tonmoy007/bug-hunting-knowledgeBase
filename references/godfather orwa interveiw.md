#### Notes
**Summary**: orwa gave a lot of information about recon and learning bug bounty and hunting.
**Notes**:
- If you your recon is good your bug is good.
- recon
	- list of domain => list of subdomain => enumerate subdomain => find the live subdomain [wrong way]
	- what is recon mean to you ? => recon isn't just automating things. It everything information gathering. Find things that other dont find.
	- Port scanning is an important part. 
	- tools he uses - amass for subdomain, subdomain enum scripts (multiple subdomain finder tool in one), fuzz for subdomain (masscan)
