#### Notes
**Summary**: 1-2 sentence overview
**Notes**:
- REST apis are stateless. API were to leverage basic authentication across all endpoints, then a username and password would have to be issued every time. Instead, the provider may leverage basic authentication once using an authentication portal, then upon providing the correct credentials, a token would be issued to be used in subsequent requests.
