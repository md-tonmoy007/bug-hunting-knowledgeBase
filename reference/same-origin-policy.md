The same-origin policy is a web browser security mechanism that aims to prevent websites from attacking each other.


### ‚úÖ What is Allowed?

Some **resources can be loaded from other websites**, even if JavaScript can‚Äôt read them:

- `<img src="other.com/image.jpg">` ‚Äì ‚úÖ allowed
- `<script src="other.com/script.js">` ‚Äì ‚úÖ allowed    
- `<video src="other.com/video.mp4">` ‚Äì ‚úÖ allowed

BUT: JavaScript **cannot look inside** the image, script, or video loaded from another site.


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Exceptions to the Rule

Some things are **partially allowed** cross-domain:

| Object/Action                                       | Readable? | Writable? | Notes                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `location.href` (URL of iframe or window)           | ‚ùå         | ‚úÖ         | You can set the URL but not read it               |
| `window.length` (number of frames)                  | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå         | Can read but not change                           |
| `window.closed` (is the window closed?)             | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå         | Can check but not set                             |
| `window.focus()`, `window.blur()`, `window.close()` | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ         | Can be used on other windows                      |
| `postMessage()`                                     | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ         | A safe way to send data between different domains |


### üç™ Cookies Exception

- Cookies are shared **between subdomains** (e.g., `shop.example.com` and `blog.example.com`) by default.
- This is **less strict**, but **you can reduce risk** by using the `HttpOnly` flag, which hides cookies from JavaScript.



### üõ†Ô∏è Relaxing SOP with `document.domain`

If two subdomains want to share data (like `marketing.example.com` and `example.com`), they can:

1. **Both set** `document.domain = "example.com"` in JavaScript.
2. Then, **JavaScript access is allowed** between them.

‚ö†Ô∏è You **cannot** set `document.domain = "com"` ‚Äì modern browsers block this for safety.
